hello-world
===========

A basic Hello World repository to practice creating GitHub repositories.

I am a Helsinkian sofware developer, who is passionate about many kinds of
programming. My main interest is front-end web development: JavaScript and
HTML/CSS, but I have a lot of skills in other programming languages as well.
Programming is not just a job for me, it is also a hobby. I write all kinds of
scripts for myself and read about IT-related subjects in my free time.
